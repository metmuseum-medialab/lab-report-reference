  How to write a lab report

Abstract
========

  Come up with a succinct, understandable set of guidlines for writing a lab report

Indroduction
============

  This is a meta-document, we want to carefully lay out what each section does. The introduction provides necessary context to understand the rest of the report.

Materials and Methods
=====================

  Materials include hardware and software
  Methods include knowledge and practices

Procedure
=========

  * Create a list of what should be done, specifying order if required
  * These items should be as atomic as possible while still being clear

Results
=======

  Results are impartial observations of what happened. No conclusions should be drawn here.
  To get good results, record data EVERY DAY ALL DAY. Be rigorous when taking notes.
  Explain why you did what you did.

Discussion
==========

  Discussion is just that - its possible conclusions, interesting threads to further study. Anything fabricated.

Conclusion
==========

  Conclusion contains the most relevant interpretations that relate back to the abstract or hypothesis.
